#### SERX94: Project Proposal

#### Semiconductor Yield Prediction

#### Anonymous

#### 10/28/2024

 ---

### Keywords:

Semiconductors, Prediction, Pass/Fail

 ---

### Description:

Analyze Semi-conductor lot features(sensor data), against whether the wafer lot passed or failed QA.

 ---

### Research Questions:

- RO1: To describe trends that can predict if a semiconductor wafer will pass or fail in house line testing.
- RO2: Predict if a semiconductor wafer will pass or fail in house line testing based on wafer features.
- RO3: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2.
- RO4: To evaluate causal relationships implied by the RO2 model.

### Intellectual Merit:

The potential of this project is significant to the Semi-conductor industry. The ability to predict whether a lot of
wafers will pass QA can mean the difference between ~$150,000 and ~2,500 depending on how bad the lot was. This is not
including the overhead of running the Semi-conductor tools, time wasted not having a tool running other lots, and labor.
Establishing tools for predicting Wafer lots pass/fail would allow companies to optimize their manufacturing process and
prevent lots from failing.

### Data Sourcing:

I will use a Semi-conductor lot Pass/Fail data
at [archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/179/secom](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/179/secom) this data is entirely
quantitative other than the qualitative Pass/Fail outcome and readable for analysis. The data has 1,567 and 591 features
to analyze. The only drawback is that the data is from 2008. However, the same principles would apply for analyzing
recent Semiconductor data.
