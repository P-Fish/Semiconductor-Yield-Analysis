#### SERX94: Project Proposal

#### Semi-conductor Pass/Fail Yield Prediction

#### 09/11/2024

Keywords: Semiconductors, Prediction, Pass/Fail

Description: Analyze Semi-conductor lot features(sensor data), against whether the wafer lot passed or failed QA.

Intellectual Merit: The potential of this project is significant to the Semi-conductor industry. The ability to predict
whether a lot of wafers will pass QA can mean the difference between ~$150,000 and ~2,500 depending on how bad the lot
was. This is not including the overhead of running the Semi-conductor tools, time wasted not having a tool running other
lots, and labor. Establishing tools for predicting Wafer lots pass/fail would allow companies to optimize their
manufacturing process and prevent lots from failing.

Data Sourcing: I was able to find a Semi-conductor lot Pass/Fail data at
```archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/179/secom```
this data is entirely quantitative and "easily" readible. Additionally the data has 1,567 and 591 features to analyze.
The only drawback is that the data is from 2008. However, the same principles would apply for analyzing recent
Semi-conductor data.
